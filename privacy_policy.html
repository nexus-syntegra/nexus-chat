    <h1>Nexus Chat Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Nexus Chat offers on-device AI processing using local language models. You can also optionally connect to external AI services. This policy explains what data stays on your device and what may be transmitted externally.</p>

    <h2>On-Device Processing</h2>
    <p>When using local AI models, your conversations are processed entirely on your device and are not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>External AI Services</h2>
    <p>Nexus Chat supports optional connections to external AI providers, including OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, and API-compatible services. When you configure and use these services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your conversations are sent to the selected provider</li>
        <li>Data handling is governed by that provider's privacy policy</li>
        <li>You are responsible for reviewing the provider's terms before use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Web Search and Research Features</h2>
    <p>Nexus Chat includes optional web search and research agent features. When enabled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Search queries and requests are sent to external services (e.g., DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, or configured endpoints)</li>
        <li>Content from websites may be retrieved and processed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features are disabled by default and require user activation.</p>

    <h2>Diagnostics and Analytics</h2>
    <p>We collect diagnostic data to maintain and improve the app, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crash reports and error logs</li>
        <li>Performance metrics</li>
        <li>General usage patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected via Firebase and is used for troubleshooting, bug fixes, and app improvements. Diagnostic data may include device information, app state at the time of an error, and interaction patterns. We do not use this data for advertising.</p>

    <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used for vision-language features. Images are processed according to your selected AI mode (local or external).</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Used for voice input. Audio is processed on-device for speech-to-text conversion.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Required for external AI services, web features, model downloads, cloud backup, subscriptions, and diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Nexus Chat integrates with the following third-party services, each governed by their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Crash reporting and analytics. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>

        <li><strong>External AI Providers:</strong> When configured (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, others). See each provider's privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>Conversation history, settings, and downloaded models are stored locally on your device. You can delete this data through the app or by uninstalling.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Nexus Chat is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
